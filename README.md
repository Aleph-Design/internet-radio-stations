# internet-radio-stations
This is an SQLite3 database containing nearly 12.000 internet radio stations.

The database contains: Hostname, Path, Port when available and Station Name.
Searching in such a huge collection is a pain, so what remains to be added is some kind of genre for each station.

As always: use it "as is".
